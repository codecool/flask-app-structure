Flask-App-Structure

This is the basic flask app structure for larger applications
which I use in my projects.
This structure follows lots of advice from here
https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/wiki/Large-app-how-to
and here
http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/22/

Dependencies of the code:
Sqlalchemy
Psycopg2
Flask-WTF
Flask-Bcrypt
Flask-Manager
Flask-Login
